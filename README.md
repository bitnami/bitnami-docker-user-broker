# What is User-broker?

The [Service Catalog project](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog/) is in incubation to bring integration with service brokers to the Kubernetes ecosystem via the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker). User Broker is a part of the Service Catalog project.

There are two different images: [`service-catalog`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-service-catalog) and [`user-broker`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-user-broker)

# TL;DR;

User Broker is part of the Service Catalog that installs into a Kubernetes cluster and runs behind the [Kubernetes API Aggregator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/apiserver-aggregation/).

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DTC)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

# Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).


* [`0-debian-10`, `0.2.2-debian-10-r106`, `0`, `0.2.2`, `latest` (0/debian-10/Dockerfile)](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-user-broker/blob/0.2.2-debian-10-r106/0/debian-10/Dockerfile)

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Service-catalog Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/user-broker).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/user-broker:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/user-broker/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/user-broker:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/user-broker:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-user-broker.git#master:0/debian-10'
```
